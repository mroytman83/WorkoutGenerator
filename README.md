# WorkoutGenerator
A GUI randomized weightlifting routine in Python 

I created a randomized workout generator based upon some conventional strength/training weightlifting workout splits which are bucketised based upon certain muscle groups. 
In the process of creating this workout generator I used a Resistance Training Planner from Manitobasâ€™ Physical Education and Health Education Curriculum with 250 exercises and their specific muscle group concentration.(https://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/physhlth/)
Finally, I made the interaction between the program and the user slightly more sophisticated by creating a graphical user interface in tkinter. 
Enjoy this program! Train hard!

Terminal Method:
	If you have trouble running the notebook after downloading it, use nbconvert to convert the notebook to an executable script. The terminal command would look like(jupyter nbconvert --to script Program.ipynb). Then, run the Program.py script in python(python Program.py)
